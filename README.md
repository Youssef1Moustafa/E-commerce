Order Status Prediction App
This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the order status (e.g., delivered, shipped) using a machine learning model. The model takes several features such as customer state, city, product category, and purchase details to provide predictions.

Features
The application uses the following features for prediction:

customer_state: State where the customer resides (e.g., NY, CA)
customer_city: City where the customer resides
order_purchase_year: Year when the order was purchased
order_purchase_month: Month of the purchase
order_purchase_day: Day of the purchase
order_estimated_delivery_month: Estimated month for delivery
order_estimated_delivery_day: Estimated day for delivery
product_category: Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Apparel)
product_category_name: Name of the product category
discount: Discount applied to the order (in percentage)
REV_gift_log: Log of gift revenue for the order
REV_gift_percent: Percentage of revenue from gifts
price_log: Logarithmic value of the product's price
How to Run the App
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You’ll also need the following Python libraries:

streamlit
numpy
pickle
sklearn
pandas
You can install the necessary libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit numpy pickle5 scikit-learn pandas
Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-status-prediction-app.git
cd order-status-prediction-app
Running the App
Make sure your machine learning model is saved as model_features.pkl and is located in the same directory as app.py. Then run the following command to launch the app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a local web server and open the app in your browser.

Usage
Customer Information: Input the customer’s state and city.
Order Details: Input the purchase year, month, and day for the order.
Estimated Delivery: Provide the estimated delivery month and day.
Product Information: Choose the product category and provide the product category name.
Price & Discount: Input the discount applied to the order, revenue from gifts (log), and the price (logarithmic scale).
Predict: Click the Predict button to get the predicted order status.
File Structure
app.py: The main application file for Streamlit.
model_features.pkl: This file contains the trained machine learning model and the list of features.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Model Training
The machine learning model used in this app is trained using features like customer state, city, order dates, product categories, discount, and price details. The model is saved in a pickle file (model_features.pkl), which is loaded at runtime.

Example
Below is an example of the interface, where you can input feature values and predict whether an order will be delivered or not:
